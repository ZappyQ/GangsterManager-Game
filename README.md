# GangsterManager

**GangsterManager** is a deep, text-based strategic life simulator that puts you in the heart of the criminal underworld. Set in a gritty urban landscape, the game challenges you to rise from a small-time hustler to a legendary crime boss through strategy, resource management, and ruthless ambition.

## 🕶️ The World of GangsterManager

The game takes place in iconic metropolitan hubs like **New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles**. You enter a world where every street corner offers an opportunity, but every decision carries a risk. In this "Night City" inspired environment, your survival depends on your ability to balance your physical needs with the demands of a growing criminal empire.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 👤 Life & Survival
Unlike typical action games, GangsterManager requires you to manage the human side of being a criminal. You must monitor your **Health, Hunger, and Thirst**. Neglecting these will end your career faster than a police raid. You'll need to visit local spots like **KFC** or **Walmart** to stock up on essentials and keep yourself in peak condition.

### 📈 Career Progression: Respect & Heat
* **Respect:** The ultimate currency. Everything you do—from successful muggings to running a gang—earns you respect. This stat determines your influence and standing in the city.
* **Wanted Level:** Every crime leaves a trail. Manage your "heat" with the law; if your wanted level gets too high, you'll find yourself constantly looking over your shoulder.

### 👥 The Gang System
You don't have to work alone. The game features a robust gang system:
* **Join the Legends:** Seek membership in established organizations like the **Bloods** or **Crips** for protection and steady work.
* **Build an Empire:** Create your own custom gang. Define your brand with a unique name and color, and choose your primary illegal business model, such as **Arms Dealing, Money Laundering, Extortion, or Cybercrime**.

### 🔫 Criminal Activities
Choose your path to riches through various activities:
* **Street Crimes:** Start small with muggings and pickpocketing.
* **Heists:** Plan and execute robberies on shops and businesses.
* **Specialized Gear:** Use items from your inventory to tilt the odds. Wear **latex gloves** to avoid leaving evidence or arm yourself with high-end weaponry to ensure the success of your operations.

### 💰 Economy & Items
The game features a detailed **Item Registry**. You can visit different specialized shops:
* **Walmart:** For basic supplies and survival gear.
* **Apple Store:** To acquire high-tech electronics for cyber-operations.
* **Gun Shops:** To upgrade your firepower.
Every item in your inventory has its own weight, value, and "wear and tear" condition, making inventory management a crucial part of your strategy.

## 🏆 Objective
There is no single way to win. Whether you want to be the wealthiest money launderer in LA or the most feared gang leader in New York, GangsterManager provides the tools to write your own criminal legacy. Survive the streets, earn your respect, and take control of the city.
